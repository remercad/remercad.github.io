          <p>India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation has announced the resumption of regular international flights to and from India from 27 March 2022 in light of decreasing cases of COVID-19. This means termination of air bubble arrangements and restoration to the pre-COVID level of services. The full regulations are available from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and the Airports Authority India on Twitter. To book tickets and to see important guidance prior to travel you should check airline websites. The British High Commission cannot assist with ticketing. The aviation sector remains unpredictable and is subject to change with short notice. To get the latest information sign up for travel advice email alerts.</p>
          <p>Severe seasonal floods in North-eastern Indian states have caused loss of life and hazardous conditions, and are disrupting transport and other services. If you are in the affected areas or intend to visit these areas, you are advised to monitor local media closely and check with the local administration before travelling. You should also monitor the local weather updates from the Indian Meteorological Department. </p>

            <figcaption>Be aware of monsoon season in India when booking your flight.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Travel in India during the monsoon season (June to October) can be hazardous. Over one million British nationals visited India in 2019. Most visits are trouble-free.Severe air pollution is a major hazard to public health, especially during the winter months. New Delhi and other North Indian cities are most affected by extremely high levels of pollution.</p>
          <p>Terrorists are very likely to carry out attacks in India. Recent attacks have targeted public places including those visited by foreigners. Media reports suggest Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) and other groups have an interest in attacking targets in India. There may be an increased threat to places visited by British nationals such as religious sites, markets, festival venues and beaches. You should be vigilant at this time, monitor local media and take all precautions for your safety.</p>
          <p>Maoist (or Naxalite) insurgents specifically target police officers, paramilitary forces and government officials in parts of India, causing several deaths and injuries in 2019/20. The government of India has identified some districts as the worst affected. You should avoid protests and large gatherings. Stampedes have occurred during some events with large crowds, including at political rallies and religious gatherings, resulting in deaths and injuries. They can happen without warning and occasionally result in disorder. See Political situation. The Indian Ministry of Tourism has a 24 hour multi-lingual telephone helpline on toll free number 1800 111 363 providing visitors to India with information about travel and tourism.</p>
